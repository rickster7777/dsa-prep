‚úÖ Your Current Solution
How it works:
First, you find all the indices where c occurs and store them in cs.

Then, for every character in s, you:

If it's not c, compute the minimum distance to every c in cs.

If it is c, distance is 0.

‚è± Time Complexity:
Outer loop: O(n)

Inner loop: O(k) (where k = number of c in s)

Total: O(n * k) ‚Äî inefficient for long strings or many occurrences of c.

/*
üöÄ Optimized Solution (Two Pass ‚Äî O(n) Time)
You can solve this in O(n) by scanning the string twice:
Left to right ‚Äî track distance to the most recent c seen.
Right to left ‚Äî track distance to the next c from the right.

üß† Why This Works:
The first pass ensures every position knows the closest c on the left.
The second pass ensures it compares and keeps the closer c from the right.
This guarantees the shortest distance from both directions efficiently.

why infinity is negative in first pass and positive in 2nd pass ?

from L to R
At the start, we haven‚Äôt seen c yet.
So, when you compute:

result[i] = Math.abs(i - prev); // when prev = -Infinity

That gives:
Math.abs(i - (-Infinity)) = Infinity
This makes sense ‚Äî until you find a real c, the distance is unknown (effectively infinite).
As soon as you see c, prev = i, and all next positions get accurate distances.


from R to L
let prev = Infinity;
We‚Äôre going right to left, so at the start of this loop, we haven‚Äôt yet seen any c on the right.

When we hit a real c, we update prev = i, and now we can compute the distance to the closest c on the right.

result[i] = Math.min(result[i], Math.abs(i - prev));

| Pass          | Initial `prev` value | Why?                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Left to right | `-Infinity`          | No `c` seen yet; far left = undefined  |
| Right to left | `Infinity`           | No `c` seen yet; far right = undefined |
