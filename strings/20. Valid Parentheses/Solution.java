Suppose I want to remember this forever So how can you put this in words

🧠 One-Line Memory Rule (This is the key)
“Every closing bracket must close the most recent unmatched opening bracket.”
That single sentence explains why a stack is used.

🧠 The Story You Should Remember
Imagine brackets are plates.
Opening brackets → put a plate on the stack
Closing brackets → remove the top plate and check if it matches

Why?
Because the last opened bracket must be closed first (LIFO).
That is exactly what a stack does.

🧩 Step-by-Step Logic in Words

1. Odd length can never be valid
    → brackets come in pairs.

2. Scan the string from left to right

    If it’s an opening bracket ( { [
        👉 push it onto the stack

    If it’s a closing bracket ) } ]
        👉 pop the stack and check:
            Stack empty? ❌ invalid
            Mismatch? ❌ invalid

3. At the end
    Stack empty → ✅ all brackets matched
    Stack not empty → ❌ some brackets never closed

🧠 Ultra-Short Interview Explanation
“I use a stack because brackets must close in reverse order of opening.
I push opening brackets, and for each closing bracket I pop and validate.
If at any point there’s a mismatch or the stack is empty, it’s invalid.
Finally, the stack must be empty.”

That’s a perfect answer.
