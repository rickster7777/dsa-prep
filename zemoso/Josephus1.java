/*
The Josephus Problem is a classic theoretical problem related to a group of people standing in a circle waiting to be eliminated. 
Every k-th person is eliminated in the circle until only one survives.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given:
n people in a circle (numbered from 1 to n)
A step size k â€” every k-th person is eliminated
Goal: Find the position (1-based) of the person who survives.
