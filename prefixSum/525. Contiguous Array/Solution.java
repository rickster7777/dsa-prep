/*
 üîç Logic Summary:
Convert the problem to finding the longest subarray with sum 0.

Replace 0s with -1 to make equal number of 0s and 1s equivalent to a net sum of 0.

Use prefix sum + hashmap to detect repeated sums and calculate lengths between them.

/*
 * üß† Algorithm (Prefix Sum + HashMap)
 * Initialize:
 * 
 * map = {0: -1} ‚Üí maps cumulative sum to its earliest index
 * max_len = 0
 * sum = 0
 * 
 * Iterate through array:
 * For each element:
 * 
 * If num == 0, treat as -1, else +1
 * Add to sum
 * 
 * If this sum has been seen before in the map:
 * Calculate length = i - map[sum]
 * Update max_len if needed
 * 
 * If not seen:
 * Store the index of first occurrence: map[sum] = i
 * 
 * üßÆ Example:
 * Input: [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
 * Convert to: [-1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,-1,-1,-1]
 * 
 * Now you're looking for longest subarray with sum = 0
