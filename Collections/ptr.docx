Step 1: Ensure You're in the Correct Directory
/dsa-prep
    /Collections
        Reflection.java

Step 2: Compile the Program
javac Collections/Reflection.java

Step 3: Run the Program with --add-opens
java --add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED Collections.Reflection


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the package structure is not needed
If your Reflection.java isn't in a package (i.e., no package Collections; at the top), you would simply 
run the commands from the directory where the Reflection.java file is located:

javac Reflection.java
java --add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED Reflection
