/**
 ðŸ§  Problem Understanding:
You're given:

A bag of tokens: each token has a cost (power required to play it).
An initial amount of power.

You start with 0 score.
You can play each token once, in one of two ways:
Face-up: Spend tokens[i] power â†’ gain +1 score
Face-down: Spend -1 score â†’ gain tokens[i] power

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Maximize your score by smartly choosing which tokens to play and how.

ðŸ§© Key Strategy:
Sort the tokens in ascending order.
Use a greedy two-pointer approach:
Start with lo = 0 (cheapest token) and hi = tokens.length - 1 (most expensive token).

While lo <= hi, do:

If you have enough power, play token[lo]:

face-up:  power -= tokens[lo], score += 1, lo++

Else if you have at least 1 score, play token[hi] 
face-down: power += tokens[hi], score -= 1, hi--

Else: you can't make any more moves â†’ break.
Track the max score seen so far.
