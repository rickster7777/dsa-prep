🎯 What's the Goal?
Your goal is to sort the array, using a sequence of these flips.

But instead of returning the sorted array, you return the list of k values that show what flips you used.

As long as the array ends up sorted after all your flips, your answer is valid.
You don't need the shortest sequence — any sequence that works within 10 * arr.length flips is fine.

🧠 Why It’s Called Pancake Sort
Imagine the array as a stack of pancakes, each one labeled with a number (their size).
You can only insert your spatula under the top k pancakes and flip them all at once.
You repeat this to sort them from smallest on top to largest on bottom — or in our case, smallest on the left to largest on the right.

🔍 Example Recap: [3,2,4,1]
We want to sort this array to [1,2,3,4].

The flips:

Flip with k = 4: Reverse whole array → [1,4,2,3]
Flip with k = 2: Reverse first 2 → [4,1,2,3]
Flip with k = 4: Reverse first 4 → [3,2,1,4]
Flip with k = 3: Reverse first 3 → [1,2,3,4] 🎉
So the output is [4, 2, 4, 3].

📦 Summary
You can only reverse the prefix of the array.
You do a series of such flips to sort the array.
You return the sequence of k values used in those flips.
Any correct sequence is valid as long as it leads to a sorted array.


how to decide what k to pick .

ChatGPT said:
Great follow-up! Understanding how to decide what k to pick is the heart of pancake sorting.

Let's break it down clearly and logically:

🧠 Goal:
Sort the array using prefix reversals (i.e., flipping the first k elements), and record each k.

🎯 Core Strategy:
At each step, find the largest unsorted number, and move it to its correct place (the end of the unsorted portion of the array).

This takes up to two flips:
Flip to bring the largest number to the front (if it's not already there).
Flip to move it to its correct position at the end of the unsorted section.

✅ Step-by-Step Logic:
Imagine you want to sort [3, 2, 4, 1]

1. Find the max in the unsorted part:
Unsorted array: [3, 2, 4, 1]
Max is 4, at index 2
It should go to index 3 (last position)

2. If the max isn't already at the end:
First, bring it to the front (flip k = index + 1 → k = 3)
Then, flip the first 4 elements to move it to the end (flip k = 4)
Now 4 is in the correct place.

3. Repeat for the rest:
Now focus on [3, 2, 1], and repeat:
Max is 3, at index 0 (already at front)
Flip k = 3 → 3 goes to the end of the subarray

Then work on [1, 2], etc.

📌 Summary of When to Flip:
Find max in unsorted portion (say from arr[0...n-1])

If max is not at the end:
If it's not already at the front, flip it to the front → k = index + 1
Flip it from front to its correct place → k = n
Reduce the size of the unsorted part by 1

Repeat

🔄 Example Recap — [3, 2, 4, 1]

Round 1:
Max is 4 at index 2
Flip k=3 → [4,2,3,1]
Flip k=4 → [1,3,2,4]

Round 2:
Unsorted part: [1,3,2]

Max is 3 at index 1
Flip k=2 → [3,1,2,4]
Flip k=3 → [2,1,3,4]

Round 3:
Unsorted part: [2,1]

Max is 2 at index 0
Flip k=1 → (no change)
Flip k=2 → [1,2,3,4] ✅

✅ So in short:
You pick k based on:

First: the position of the largest remaining element.
Second: where it needs to go (end of current unsorted subarray).
You may do one or two flips to move it.
