/*
âœ… 1. Two Arrays (Prefix/Suffix Max) â€” O(n) time, O(n) space
Steps:
Build leftMax[]: max height from left to current index.
Build rightMax[]: max height from right to current index.
For each index i, compute min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i] (if positive), and add to result.


âœ… 2. Two Pointers â€” O(n) time, O(1) space
Idea: You donâ€™t need two full arrays. You can just keep track of:
leftMax as you move from left
rightMax as you move from right

Steps:
Start with two pointers: left = 0, right = n - 1
Track leftMax, rightMax
Move the pointer that has the smaller wall, and calculate trapped water accordingly

Why this works: Because water is trapped based on the shorter of the two sides.


âœ… When to Use Stack Approach?
Itâ€™s great for interview questions where the problem needs one-pass logic with a monotonic stack.
Slightly harder to write and debug compared to the two-pointer method.


ðŸ§± Stack-Based Approach â€” O(n) Time, O(n) Space
âœ… Core Idea:
We use a stack to keep track of indices of increasing height bars.

When we find a bar taller than the top of the stack, it means:
We can now trap water between the current bar and the bar below the top of the stack.
The top of the stack acts as the bottom of the container.

/*
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case,
6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
