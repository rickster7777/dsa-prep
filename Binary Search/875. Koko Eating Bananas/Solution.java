             * pile / k in Java does integer division and always rounds down.
             * For example, 7 / 4 = 1 (but you actually need 2 hours to eat 7 bananas at

             * (pile + k - 1) / k is a trick to simulate ceil(pile / k) using integer math.

             * Koko can't eat partial bananas or split hours. If a pile isn't finished in an
             * exact number of hours, she needs a full extra hour for the leftovers.
             * So, we must always round up the division, which is what (pile + k - 1)

/*
 * In Java, Math.ceil(pile / k) does not work as expected because pile / k is
 * integer division, which truncates (rounds down) before Math.ceil is applied.
 * For example, Math.ceil(7 / 4) is Math.ceil(1) which is 1, but you actually
 * want 2.
 * 
 * To get the correct ceiling division, you must first convert to double or use
 * the integer trick:
 * 
 * Correct with double:
 * Math.ceil((double)pile / k) â†’ this gives the correct result, but returns a
 * double, so you need to cast to int.
 * 
 * Efficient integer trick:
 * (pile + k - 1) / k
 * This always rounds up and works with integers, so it's preferred for
 * performance and simplicity.

/*
 * âœ… The Correct Simulation for piles = [3,6,7,11] and k = 4:
 * We calculate hours per pile like this:
 * 
 * Pile 0: 3 / 4 â†’ 1 hour
 * Pile 1: 6 / 4 â†’ 2 hours (6 bananas â†’ 4 in first hour, 2 in second)
 * Pile 2: 7 / 4 â†’ 2 hours
 * Pile 3: 11 / 4 â†’ 3 hours
 * 
 * We use ceiling division:
 * 
 * hours = (pile + k - 1) / k
 * So:
 * Total hours = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8
 * âœ… Therefore, k = 4 works for h = 8.
 * 
 * ðŸ“Œ Summary:
 * Each pile takes ceil(pile / k) hours.
 * Koko eats from only one pile per hour, never splitting time between multiple
 * piles.
 * So we don't track remaining bananas manually, we just calculate time needed
 * for each pile.
