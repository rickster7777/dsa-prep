Basic Operations on Linked Lists:
Traversal: Moving through the list, node by node, starting from the head.
Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or in the middle of the list.
Deletion: Removing a node from the list (from the beginning, middle, or end).
Searching: Finding a node with a specific value.
Reversing: Changing the order of nodes in the list.


Advantages of Linked Lists
Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a predefined size. You can easily grow or shrink the list.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting elements at the beginning or middle of the list can be done in constant time, O(1), if the position is known.
Disadvantages of Linked Lists
Extra Memory: Each node requires extra memory for the pointer to the next node.
Random Access is Not Possible: To access an element, you have to traverse the list from the head to the desired node, making it slower than an array for direct access.
