Approach 1:
for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
int k = target - nums[i];
}


Approach 2:
int k = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
k = target - nums[i];

Which is a better approach and why ?

Approach 1 (Recommended ✅)
Why this is better
1️⃣ Correct scope (most important)

k is only needed inside the loop
Declaring it inside the loop:
Limits its visibility
Prevents accidental misuse elsewhere
This follows the rule: “Declare variables as close as possible to where they are used.”

2️⃣ Cleaner and safer

Each iteration gets a fresh k.
There is no chance of:
Using an old value
Forgetting to update it
Logical bugs when code changes later

3️⃣ Easier to read

When someone reads:
int k = target - nums[i];
They instantly understand:

“This value is tied to this iteration.”
No mental tracking required.

4️⃣ Better for maintenance

If later you:
Add conditions
Add nested loops
Refactor logic
You won’t accidentally depend on a stale value of k.

Approach 2 (Works, but not ideal ⚠️)

What’s wrong with it?
❌ k exists outside the loop, even though it’s not needed there
❌ Higher risk of accidental misuse later
❌ Slightly harder to reason about
❌ Breaks clean scoping principles

Performance Difference? ❌ None
