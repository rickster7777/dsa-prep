✅ Optimal Solution: Reverse Method (O(n) time, O(1) space)
Steps
Reverse the entire array
Reverse the first k elements
Reverse the remaining n - k elements

Example
nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3

Reverse all:        [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
Reverse first k:    [5,6,7,4,3,2,1]
Reverse rest:       [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
k = k % n;  // Handle cases where k > n

Explain in a simple and easy to understand manner that why it's needed
and in general in what all scenarios, it is. Used


Why do we do k = k % n?
Think in terms of full rotations

n = length of the array

Rotating the array n times brings it back to the same original state

So:
Rotate n times → no change
Rotate n + 1 times → same as rotating 1 time
Rotate n + k times → same as rotating k times

That’s exactly what modulus (%) captures.

Simple Example
Array nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
n = 5

Case 1: k = 2
Right rotate by 2 → [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

Case 2: k = 7
7 = 5 + 2
Rotate by 5 → no change
Rotate by 2 → same result

So:
k = 7 % 5 = 2

👉 Both give the same final array

What happens if we don’t do this?
Example
nums = [1,2,3], k = 100

Without % n:

We may try to reverse or access indices incorrectly
Logic may break or do unnecessary work

Performance may suffer

With % n:

100 % 3 = 1


So we only rotate once, which is correct and efficient.

Intuition (Real-life analogy 🚶)

Imagine walking around a circular track with 10 steps:
Walk 10 steps → back to start
Walk 12 steps → same as walking 2 steps
Walk 27 steps → same as walking 7 steps

That’s:
effectiveSteps = totalSteps % trackLength;

In General, When Is % Used?
1️⃣ Circular data structures

Rotate array
Circular queue
Ring buffer

index = (index + k) % n;

2️⃣ Repeating patterns / cycles

Clock problems
Days of the week
Pattern repetition
day = (day + k) % 7;

3️⃣ Prevent index out of bounds
Ensures index always stays within [0, n-1]

4️⃣ Optimization
Reduces large numbers into meaningful small ones

Key Takeaway ⭐
Modulo helps you remove “full cycles” and keep only what actually matters.

In rotate array:
k = k % n;

means:
“Ignore all complete rotations — keep only the extra steps.”


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When % n Is Used (General Rule)
You’ll almost always see % n when:

1️⃣ Rotating arrays or strings
2️⃣ Working with circular buffers
3️⃣ Calculating cyclic indices
4️⃣ Preventing index overflow
5️⃣ Mapping large values into a fixed range
