Introduction to Bit Manipulation [Theory]

Binary Number Conversion
Decimal to Binary Conversion:
By repeatedly dividing a number by 2 and recording the result, decimal values can be transformed into binary.

Example: Converting 13 to its binary equivalent:

Start with the decimal number 13.
Divide the number by 2 and record the remainder.
Repeat the division with the quotient until the number becomes 0.
13 / 2 = 6 remainder 1
6 / 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1
To obtain the binary equivalent of 13, read the remainders from bottom to top: 1101.

So, the binary equivalent of 13 is 1101.

Binary to Decimal Conversion:
Converting a binary number back to its decimal equivalent involves a reverse process.

Example: Converting 1101 to its decimal equivalent:

Start from the rightmost bit (least significant bit).
Each bit is multiplied by 2 raised to the power of its position index.
1 * 2^0 = 1
0 * 2^1 = 0
1 * 2^2 = 4
1 * 2^3 = 8
Sum = 1 + 0 + 4 + 8 = 13.

Hence, the decimal equivalent of the binary number 1101 is 13.

Understanding One's Complement and Two's Complement


One's Complement
The one's complement of a binary number is obtained by flipping all the bits.

Example: The one's complement of 13 (binary 1101):

Binary of 13     : 0000 1101
One's Complement : 1111 0010


Two's Complement
The two's complement is obtained by taking the one's complement of a number and adding 1.

Example: The two's complement of 13 (binary 1101):

One's Complement : 1111 0010
Add 1            : 1111 0011


Bitwise Operators

1. AND Operator (&)
If both corresponding bits are 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it is 0.

13: 1101
7: 0111
&  : 0101 → 5

2. OR Operator (|)
If either corresponding bit is 1, the resulting bit is 1.

13: 1101
7: 0111
|  : 1111 → 15

3. XOR Operator (^)
If bits differ, the result is 1;
if the same, result is 0.


13: 1101
7: 0111
^  : 1010 → 10


✔ Result is true if only one number is negative.
| Bit A | Bit B | A ^ B |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 0     | 1     | 1     |
| 1     | 0     | 1     |
| 1     | 1     | 0     |


Important Properties of XOR
✔ XOR with 0
x ^ 0 = x

✔ XOR with itself
x ^ x = 0

✔ XOR is reversible
a ^ b ^ b = a



4. NOT Operator (~)
Flips all bits of the number.

 5: 0000 0101
~5: 1111 1010 → -6 (in two's complement)

5. Shift Operators
Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right, fills left with 0s.

13 >> 1 = 0110 → 6
Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left, fills right with 0s.

13 << 1 = 11010 → 26





Bit Manipulation Tricks and Techniques

1. Swapping Two Numbers Without a Third Variable
A = A ^ B
B = A ^ B
A = A ^ B

2. Checking if the i-th Bit is Set
(1 << i) & num   → set if result ≠ 0
(num >> i) & 1   → set if result ≠ 0

3. Setting the i-th Bit
num | (1 << i)

4. Clearing the i-th Bit
num & ~(1 << i)

5. Toggling the i-th Bit
num ^ (1 << i)

6. Check sign difference (used in division problem)
boolean isNegative = (a < 0) ^ (b < 0);
