🔹 What are Frequency Count Problems?

Problems where you:
Count how many times something appears
Use that count to make a decision (unique, duplicate, majority, anagram, etc.)

🔹 Common Data Structures Used

| Scenario                 | Best Choice    |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Limited range (a–z, 0–9) | Array          |
| Any characters / objects | HashMap        |
| Order matters            | LinkedHashMap  |
| Top-K frequent           | HashMap + Heap |


🔹 Core Pattern (Template)
1️⃣ Build frequency
for (element : input) {
    freq[element]++;
}

2️⃣ Use frequency
for (element : input or freq) {
    if (freq[element] condition) {
        // answer
    }
}

🔹 Classic Frequency Count Problems (Must-Know)
1️⃣ First Unique Character

LeetCode 387
Count frequency
Return first index where count == 1

2️⃣ Check Anagram

LeetCode 242
count[s1[i]]++
count[s2[i]]--

3️⃣ Majority Element

LeetCode 169
Count occurrences
Element appearing > n/2

4️⃣ Find Duplicates

LeetCode 217
If freq > 1 → duplicate exists

5️⃣ Sort Characters by Frequency

LeetCode 451
Count frequency
Sort by count

6️⃣ Top K Frequent Elements

LeetCode 347
HashMap + Min Heap

7️⃣ First Repeating Character

First character with freq > 1

8️⃣ Character Replacement / Sliding Window

Maintain frequency dynamically

🔹 How to Identify a Frequency Problem (Interview Trick)

If the question says:

“how many times”
“unique / duplicate”
“first / most frequent”
“anagram / rearrange”

👉 Think frequency map immediately

🔹 Interview-Ready Decision Guide

Ask yourself:
    Is the input range small? → Use array
    Do I need order? → LinkedHashMap
    Just count & query? → HashMap
    Need max/min frequency? → Heap

🔹 Example: Generic Frequency Template (Java)
Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
    freq.put(c, freq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
}

🔹 Key Takeaway

80% of string & array interview problems boil down to frequency counting.

If you master:
    Building frequency
    Using it correctly
    Choosing the right data structure
You’ll crack most of them easily.

If you want, I can:
    Give you a practice list ordered by difficulty
    Show mistakes interviewers look for
    Provide one reusable template per category
